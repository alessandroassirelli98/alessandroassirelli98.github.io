# Overview

As a course project for the optimization based robot control course I have developed a DQN Reinforcement Learning algorithm in order to perform a simple swing up manuever with a double pendulum robot. The project, while being rather simple to implement represented a nice showcase of how to perform robot control using RL

# Short description



# Results

I have developed the firmware for both the transmitter and the receiver on a Nordic nrf52832 mcu. The transmission introduced a delay of around 5.5 ms measured with the PicoScope oscilloscope. Finally we also mounted our system on a regular drone and verified that the delay was still small enough to let the drone fly.
